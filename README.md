# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Titles SQL Project
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the **Netflix Titles Dataset**, which contains metadata on all movies and TV shows available on Netflix up to mid-2021. The goal is to demonstrate SQL querying skills, data exploration techniques, and data-driven insights using a real-world dataset.

## ðŸ›  Data Import Process (CSV)
The Netflix Titles dataset was successfully imported into **MySQL** using the built-in CSV import functionality in **MySQL Workbench**. The import process auto-generated the schema based on the CSV structure and resolved previous encoding issues by setting the proper character set.

### âœ… Steps Followed:
1. Open **MySQL Workbench** and Create database using command ``` CREATE DATABASE Netflix;```.
2. Right-click on **Tables** â†’ Select **Table Data Import Wizard**.
3. Choose the CSV file: `netflix_titles.csv`.
4. In the wizard, review and confirm column mappings.
5. Make sure to set encoding to `UTF-8` (important for special characters).
6. Click **Next** to complete the import.
   
## ðŸ§  Project Objectives

- Practice and showcase SQL skills from beginner to advanced.
- Extract meaningful insights from Netflix's content catalog.
- Build a reusable library of SQL queries for similar datasets.
- Prepare and clean data using SQL expressions.
- Optionally integrate results with a BI tool (Power BI, Tableau, etc.).
